<h1>Books I've Read</h1>

<p>
  In January of 2014, I started compiling a list of all the books I've read.
  2014 marked the end of my junior year in high school, so the beginning of this
  list represents a lot of literature courses I took in hich school and college.
  I count listening to an audiobook as having read it, but my reading setup
  consists of Audible, my Kindle, and actual dead-tree books.

<p>
  This list contains {{ books.count if books.count else "0" }} books, and is
  automatically generated from an Airtable database.

{% for yearListing in books.yearListings %}

<h2>{{yearListing.year}}</h2>

<ul>
  {% for book in yearListing.books %}
  <li>{{ book.title }} - {{ book.author }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% endfor %}
